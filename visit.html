                The Pantheon showcases the enduring brilliance of classical design and engineering. Built under Marcus Agrippa's direction during Augustus's reign (27 BCE - 14 CE), it was later refined by Emperor Hadrian around 126 CE, creating the structure we see today. The iconic dome, a marvel of Roman engineering, demonstrates their ingenuity with the use of concrete and the oculus, a central opening that brings natural light into the interior. This architectural gem has fascinated visitors for centuries with its timeless features</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Pantheon, meaning "All the Gods" in Greek, started as a revered Roman temple under Marcus Agrippa during Augustus's reign. As Christianity rose, it transformed into a Christian church in the 7th century, blending religious traditions and ensuring its preservation. This adaptive conversion marked a crucial chapter in the Pantheon's history, exemplifying its cultural resilience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Pantheon, a must-see landmark, showcases ancient Roman engineering with its iconic dome and meticulously designed oculus.

                The construction of the Arch of Titus, initiated in the early 1st century AD, marked a significant architectural endeavor that culminated in its completion in 81 AD, during the reign of Emperor Domitian. This triumphal arch, located on the prominent Via Sacra near the Roman Forum, stands as a lasting testament to the military achievements of Titus, the elder brother of Domitian</p>
            <br>
            <p> Among Titus's remarkable feats, the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD stands out prominently. This pivotal campaign resulted in the capture and sacking of the city by Roman forces, an event that found its immortalisation on the arch's reliefs. Of particular note was the acquisition of valuable spoils, including the Menorah, a seven-branched candelabrum from the sacred Jewish Temple, which the Romans triumphantly brought back to Rome. The reliefs on the Arch of Titus not only capture the intensity of the Siege of Jerusalem but also emphasize the symbolic significance of the spoils, showcasing the prowess of Roman military might and the Flavian dynasty's influence across the vast reaches of the empire.

            <br>
            <p> These inscriptions, etched into the stone, intricately detail the military accomplishments of Titus, particularly his leadership during the Siege of Jerusalem. Additionally, they highlight the profound admiration and dedication expressed by Domitian, emphasizing the familial bonds that defined the Flavian dynasty. These inscriptions not only contribute to the arch's historical narrative but also underscore the significance of Titus's victories in the broader context of Roman imperial history.</p>
