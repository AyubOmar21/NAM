                Who was Olja Džuverović? What is her legacy? And what was it like being a working woman during the Non-Aligned Movement? Olja was one of the few women closely working in the movement, prompting a discussion on the role of women and female personhood during the Cold War period. She would often only refer to herself as ‘politički radnik’ in Serbian which translates to ‘political worker’, highlighting her humility as she worked towards a greater cause.

            <p>
                This exhibition seeks to honour and celebrate the life of Olja through the display of a selection of correspondences, photographs, and bulletins extracted from the extensive archive of materials she left behind. Spanning across four continents, it is through these artefacts that we can begin to dissect the scope and scale of the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as her own impact.

                Džuverović’s Non-Aligned Archive is a compilation of her personal letters, correspondences, bulletins, magazines, and personal objects all relating to her role as a political diplomat in Yugoslavia during the time of the movement. It is through this archive that her story as a woman in a male-dominated environment shines through, prompting an examination of the intricacies of female-personhood within the Non-Aligned Movement.
